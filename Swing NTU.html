            <h4>A website designed to improve information sharing among exchange students</h4>
            <p>Swing NTU is a social platform designed and developed in the Web Programming Course with an aim of <strong>improving the experience of information sharing among exchange students</strong> using online shared spreadsheets. The platform empowers exchange students with <strong>intuitive sorting, keyword searches, and robust data protection</strong>, fostering efficient and reliable communication. Swing NTU creates a secure and convenient environment for exchange students to find and share information throughout the application process.

            <h4>Exchange students struggle to seek information using the shared spread sheet </h4>
            <p>When I was applying for the exchange program, I found myself in a state of confusion when it came to filling out the application forms. That's when I saw a <strong>shared spreadsheet</strong> in the school forum, where <strong>students who also applied for exchange programs shared information and the schools they intended to apply to</strong>. Based on the content in the spreadsheet, I found it more clear which schools I might choose from. However, I soon realized that <strong>the spreadsheet's usability was lacking</strong>. There were two problems regarding the shared spead sheet.

                <p>The comments <strong>failed to follow a specific direction or order</strong>. In order to emphasize the importance of their comments, users <strong>highlighted them in different colors</strong>, leading to the chaotic interface. Therefore, as they navigate through the content, they must rely on "arrows" to find the context of the comments.

                <h6>What I've learned</h6>
                <p>This is my first time engaging in a real-world design project. I realized that there are many limitations. For example, I didn't have much time and resources to conduct user research in the beginning of the project, and we spent lots of time to confirm technical feasibility. Therefore, I learned to start with establishing hypotheses based on existing information, discuss with the team, and make adjustments accordingly. While it might seem uncertain at first, it helps me to gather feedback and reach consensus with the team more efficiently. 
                    l also learned it's important to step in users' shoes and design simple and intuitive interfaces, especially when most users are unfamiliar with technology.

                <p>If I knew we couldn't interview many users, I'd spend more time on desk research at the beginning of the project. Understanding the industry more comprehensively would help me to empathize with the users better later on. Moreover, I'd want to test the design with real users, and refine the design based on their feedback.

            <div class="mt-2">
                <p>I didn't know much about UX at the time I was working on the project. I learned later that the observations from users' opinions, functional design, and interface presentation were all strongly tied to UX. I got into my first UX project by mistake, which sparked my interest and understanding of UX! The project also helped me realize how much I like uncovering underlying issues and brainstorming solutions in everyday life. I truly enjoy solving problems in the process of project execution.
