            <h4>Explore in-car navigation systems' impact on drivers' feelings and behaviors</h4>
            <p>In the "Huma-computer Interaction and User Studies" course, my team and I conducted user research on the topic of <strong>"Drivers' Negative Emotions while Interacting with In-Car Navigation Systems"</strong>. Through interviews with 12 participants who had experience using in-car navigation systems while driving, we found that <strong>in-car navigation systems have little impact on drivers' negative emotions</strong> during driving. However, <strong>the driving experience</strong> has shown to influence users' interactions with in-car navigation systems. The study not only enhanced our understanding of user behavior and experiences with in-car navigation systems but also provided insights for future design and improvements in in-car navigation systems.

            <h4>Does in-car navigation systems' drawbacks impact drivers' emotions?</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Driving is one of the most prevalent methods of transportation for modern people. However, because of the continual threat of accidents, it requires <strong>a high level of concentration</strong> to stay focused. Drivers inevitably rely on navigation systems for guidance while driving. We've found that <strong>most in-car navigation systems are less convenient and complete than mobile applications, in terms of interface and functionality</strong>. This difference forces drivers to <strong>put in extra effort to become familiar with the interface of in-car navigation systems</strong>. As a result, in this study, we aim to <strong>understand whether the interaction between drivers and in-car navigation systems may result in negative emotions during the driving process</strong>.
